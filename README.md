# Spotify API project for Programming and Data Visualization for Researchers class

This is a project created for my exam in Programming and Data Visualization for Researchers, a class offered at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. 

The project uses the Spotify web API and the spotipy python package to access my personal spotify metadata. I am looking into my top tracks and how 'danceability' influences how it is ranked on my top list, as well as what genres i listen to most. 

For easy readability, this project is split into two notebooks. One for getting access and retreving data from Spotify, and one for working with the datasets. This means that anyone who clones this project will not be able to get access their own spotify data without the Secret ID. If you want to use this project to get access to your own spotify data, the secret ID needs to be requested from me separately.
